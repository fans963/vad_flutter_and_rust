# Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots and demo images for the VAD application documentation.

## Adding Screenshots

To add screenshots to the main README:

1. Place screenshot images in this directory
2. Reference them in the main README.md using relative paths:
   ```markdown
   ![Screenshot Description](assets/screenshots/your-image.png)
   ```

## Recommended Screenshots

Consider adding the following screenshots to showcase the application:

- Main application interface
- Audio waveform visualization
- FFT spectrum analysis view
- File loading dialog
- Theme variations (light/dark mode)
- Multi-file comparison view
- Tool panel and controls

## Image Guidelines

- Use PNG format for screenshots with transparency
- Recommended width: 800-1200px for main screenshots
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `waveform-view.png`, `fft-analysis.png`)
- Optimize images for web viewing to keep file sizes reasonable
